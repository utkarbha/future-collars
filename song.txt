[Verse 1]
This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for the faith departed
And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud

[Chorus]
It's my life
It's now or never
But I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive

[Chorus]
It's my life
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just want to live while I'm alive

[Chorus]
It's my life
It's now or never
But I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive

[Chorus]
It's my life
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just want to live while I'm alive

It's my life
